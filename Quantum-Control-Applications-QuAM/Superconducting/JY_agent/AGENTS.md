# JY_agent instructions

Use the MCP tools exposed by the persistent JY server for superconducting-qubit
bring-up. Read `rules/PLAYBOOK.md` and `rules/policies.yaml` before proposing an
experiment. Also read `rules/experiences/README.md` and the relevant
`rules/experiences/<node>.md` file when it exists; use accepted entries as starting
parameters only, never as a substitute for validating the current qubit.

On the exact phrase `進入 JY 量測模式`, first ensure the local infrastructure by
running `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File
.\ensure_server.ps1` from this directory, or repository-root
`.\jy_agent.ps1 -Action Ensure`, when it is not already healthy. This is
an idempotent bootstrap, not a measurement: it starts or reuses the loopback MCP,
Approval HTTP service, and token-protected Cloudflare quick tunnel that exposes
only the Approval/Dashboard port. Never expose MCP or a non-loopback listener.
If the tunnel or local services cannot be established safely, report it and stop.
If Ensure reports `recovery_only`, do not enter either measurement mode or create
a public tunnel; use only the lab PC's loopback operator console until the lock
is formally recovered.

Treat `進入JY量測模式` as an exact whitespace-only alias, and likewise treat
`進入JY自動量測模式` as an alias of `進入 JY 自動量測模式`. Also accept
`Enter JY measurement mode` and `Enter JY automatic measurement mode` as exact
English aliases. The bilingual user command list is in `Command.md`.

After bootstrap, keep the two entry phrases distinct but use their returned shared
session dashboard URL for human review. `進入 JY 量測模式` calls
`jy_enter_measurement_mode` and starts conversational mode: discuss and propose
exactly one policy-registered experiment at a time, use `jy_list_experiments` and
`jy_request_conversational_run`, preserve and show the entry response
`browser_url`, wait for each approval on its Approval page, then execute/analyze it;
any state commit also appears there. `進入 JY 自動量測模式` calls
`jy_enter_autonomy_mode`, shows its session `browser_url`, waits for the one
bounded-lease activation with `jy_wait_for_autonomy_status`, and then uses only
`jy_autonomy_*` execution tools. On hosts with durable goals, automatic-mode
entry creates one session goal and keeps waiting/advancing until completion,
operator stop, lease expiry, or hard stop. On other hosts, keep the current turn
alive while possible but do not promise indefinite model lifetime; `已核准` is
the Dashboard wake-up fallback. Never run both modes against one live lease.
Outside those modes, do not call experiment or state-changing JY tools. Treat
unrelated requests as general conversation, require an exact entry phrase again,
and never silently abort an experiment.

Treat configured exit/stop wording such as `退出 JY 量測模式`, `結束量測`,
`停止量測`, and their spacing variants as a full service shutdown. Persist the
session shutdown intent first. If a run is active, submit its authenticated
cooperative stop request and poll it to a terminal state; after the configured
grace period, force-stop only the verified worker PID. Then call
`jy_leave_measurement_mode` (or `jy_stop_workflow`) and run `powershell -NoProfile
-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\stop_server.ps1` from this directory. The script
must close the verified MCP service, Approval HTTP service, and public Cloudflare
tunnel. This is risk-reducing and needs no new approval. A retained hardware lock
is never removed automatically: after all JY workers are verified dead, the
script closes the services and leaves the lock in local recovery quarantine.
The next Ensure is local recovery-only until formal operator recovery succeeds.

If entry fails because stale JY services, a workflow, or lifecycle metadata was
left open, instruct the user to issue `恢復` or `Recover`. This close-state
recovery does not depend on an attached MCP: run repository-root
`jy_agent.ps1 -Action Recover`. It cooperatively stops a verified worker, closes
open workflow/lease/session state, then stops verified services and the tunnel.
It never deletes a retained lock or kills an unidentified process. Report
`closed_recovery_required` as services-closed/local-quarantine, not a crash or a
successful new measurement entry.

Classified QOP/OPX/instrument connectivity failures are a pause condition, not a
generic crash. Do not schedule a new experiment until the operator repairs
connectivity and resumes the same mode. Dashboard controls remain usable if the
AI app disconnects; after reconnecting, `結束量測` / `End measurement` verifies
shutdown. Map `暫停 JY 自動量測` / `Pause JY automatic measurement`, `繼續 JY
自動量測` / `Resume JY automatic measurement`, `結束 JY 自動授權` / `End JY
automatic authorization`, and `緊急停止 JY worker` / `Emergency stop JY worker`
to their corresponding server controls.

The Dashboard may be local or a token-protected public HTTPS URL. Its stable `/`
entry resolves the active session and links to three views: Home (status, device
pairing, and full shutdown), Approval, and Results & controls. Every run remains
in the Results experiment-number dropdown until full service shutdown. Wait
for the human to review scope, limits, prior result plots, Decision, Reason, next
action, and payload, then type the exact confirmation on that page. The
interactive terminal command is fallback only. Never substitute or fabricate a
URL. Show the user only the entry result's top-level `browser_url`; nested page
URLs are internal navigation on the same Dashboard service, not additional
websites. Legacy `/approve/...`, `/autonomy/...`, and `/session/...` links redirect
to the appropriate current view. Never use
the lease outside its targets/nodes or after pause, expiry, revocation, or halt.
Low confidence, `needs_review`, and `manual_review` do not themselves pause the
lease, but only a completed `pass` run with an identical recorded decision patch
may use unattended scientific state commit. Wait on bounded status/events between actions.
In automatic mode, each `(node, qubit)` has an independent 20-attempt budget. When one qubit reaches
that limit without usable evidence, treat it as incomplete for that node, do not
schedule it again under the lease, and continue resolved qubits into later nodes.
Quota exhaustion is not a lease-wide halt; snapshot, worker, state-hash, hardware
lock, and parameter-policy failures remain immediate lease-wide halts.
While the lease remains active, keep executing safe in-scope retries and later
nodes until the workflow completes. Stop scheduling a target only when evidence
shows it is scientifically unusable, its node/qubit quota is exhausted, lease
time expires, or a configured hard stop/operator control occurs. For 04 and 05,
use `jy_recommend_0405_snr_retry`: completion requires robust SNR >= 14 and >= 25
respectively, and low-SNR subgroups should increase `num_averages` within policy.
When every safe authorized adjustment for an unresolved qubit is exhausted,
leave it incomplete, continue other resolvable qubits, and report the attempted
parameters plus observed evidence to the user. The Results page exposes four
operator states: pause after the current run, resume the same unexpired lease,
end/revoke automation while keeping the site, and emergency-stop the worker while
keeping the site. Home alone exposes full shutdown, protected by an exact second
confirmation; it closes the workflow, Dashboard, HTTP services, and tunnel.
When the user supplies a new
testing strategy, record it in the relevant experience/rule file before applying
it to later work. Treat `暫停 JY 自動量測` as `jy_pause_autonomy`. Dialogue stop,
exit, and shutdown wording performs the full workflow/service shutdown; an
emergency-stop request first uses `jy_emergency_stop_autonomy` and then closes
services after the run is terminal. These controls are risk-reducing and need no
new approval proposal.

This repository may be used by different internal users and MCP-capable agents.
From the repository root, Codex, Claude, and Cursor use `jy_agent.ps1 -Action
Stdio`, which resolves this directory without depending on the outer folder name;
opening this `JY_agent` directory directly remains compatible. Both paths reach
`start_mcp_stdio.ps1`, which initializes only the client-owned STDIO protocol.
Dashboard/network bootstrap stays outside MCP initialization and runs
idempotently only after an entry phrase, so a tunnel problem cannot corrupt the
MCP `initialize` response.
Use a stable, user-specific `client_id` for the audit log; always call status
before starting or resuming because workflows and the hardware lock are shared.

Never edit or generate files in `../calibration_graph/` or `../Script/`. Never
run those Python files directly, write active `state.json` directly, remove the
hardware lock, or approve a proposal on the user's behalf.

Treat node outcomes as advisory. Analyze the saved snapshot, state the Decision
and Reason, and give the next node plus new parameters. Keep user-facing run
reports to result plot(s) and two or three short sentences. Embed every returned
result plot directly in the conversation; a local file path or link alone is not
a completed report. Show `Decision` and `Reason` before the next required approval
appears on the preserved session dashboard (state commit first when required,
otherwise the next run). If a run
fails before producing a snapshot, explicitly state that no result plot exists
and explain the failure instead of omitting the plot silently.

Use thermal reset by default for every reset-capable experiment. Only an accepted
active-reset 07b result with two compact clouds and normalized readout fidelity
at least 0.85 qualifies that qubit for explicit active reset downstream. Before
any active-reset 05st/06st run, use the conditional prerequisite-verification
path to repeat and accept 05, 06, and 06b with active reset. After same-reset
baselines and their lifetime windows pass, run each statistics node once with
`histo_num=100`; do not refit all 100 raw iterations or add a 100/100 secondary
acceptance gate.

After an experiment is accepted, append a traceable entry to
`rules/experiences/<node>.md` using the schema in `rules/experiences/README.md`. Record useful
failed/recovery observations only as explicitly labeled lessons; do not mix them
with accepted settings. Never promote a parameter to experience without a saved
snapshot and the node-specific acceptance evidence.

Use `~/.qualibrate/config.toml` as the sole source for QuAM state, wiring, Data,
project, and calibration-library paths. Do not duplicate those paths in JY config.
