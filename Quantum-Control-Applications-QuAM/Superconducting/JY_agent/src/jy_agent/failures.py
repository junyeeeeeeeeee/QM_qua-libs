    Generic timeouts and arbitrary ``OSError`` values are intentionally not
    enough on their own: a fitting or file timeout must remain a normal worker
    failure.  ``safe_to_release_lock`` is true when either:

    - a transport connection was never established, or
    - QOP rejected the program at compile/queue time with an Internal error
      (job never owned the hardware, so retaining the lock is unnecessary).

    ``program_submission_timeout`` is reported separately from
    ``instrument_unreachable``.  A deadline that expires while the program is
    being handed to the QOP is not evidence that the instrument is
    unreachable: every earlier call in the same run was answered.  It usually
    means the program is too large for one submission, so the caller may
    retry with a smaller multiplex group.  The classifier cannot tell that
    apart from a QOP that is alive but wedged, so the caller must confirm with
    a live reachability probe before acting on this category.
